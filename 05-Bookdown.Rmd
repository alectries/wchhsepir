# Bookdown

Bookdown is a format just like what you see now: a reader page with content and view options with a navigator outline on the left. It's very useful for reference documentation (I frequently use manuals generated in Bookdown, like the [R Graphics Cookbook](https://r-graphics.org)) but it can also be used in cases like this presentation, where you want to display R code in a nice, readable way, run it in the document, and surround it with explanation.

## File structure

When you open the `In-Service Bookdown` folder, you'll see all the content used to generate this presentation.

- The settings files `_bookdown.yml` and `_output.yml`, which are mostly auto-generated.
- The RMarkdown files I wrote, including `index.Rmd` and each of the numbered .Rmd files.
- The `.Rproj` file you should open if you want to view or work with the project's raw code.
- The various (deidentified) data files used to generate the content of the presentation, including `census_18-22.csv`, `wake_zips.csv`, and the files in `Tables`.
- The screenshots taken for the Respiratory Viruses section under `Images`.
- The Notifiables Table webpage created for the 2024 CD Report.
- HTML files and associated items, which are mostly in `_book`.

Also in the main folder is the `Data` folder, which contains all identified line list data used for this presentation. It is accessible on the SharePoint, but is not exported so I don't take confidential data with me when I leave.

## Bookdown package

Bookdown is not included with RStudio. To get it, run `install.packages("bookdown")` in your RStudio console.

Everything you need to know to use Bookdown can be found in the [Bookdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

Once you have the package installed, try it out! Bookdown comes with lots of useful instructions and examples to get you started.
